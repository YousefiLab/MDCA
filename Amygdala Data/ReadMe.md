# Expriment Description
In this project, we use empirical point-process coherence and global coherence analysis to study the human Amygdala dataset.

## Data
We present an electrophysiological dataset collected from the amygdalae of nine subjects attending a visual dynamic stimulation of emotional aversive content. The subjects were patients affected by epilepsy who underwent preoperative invasive monitoring in the mesial temporal lobe. Subjects were presented with dynamic visual sequences of fearful faces (aversive condition), interleaved with sequences of neutral landscapes (neutral condition).

We provide the recordings of intracranial EEG (iEEG) and metadata related to the task, subjects, sessions and electrodes in the BIDS standard. 

Data is publicly available. Please check the [OpenNeuro Repository](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003374/versions/1.1.1)
