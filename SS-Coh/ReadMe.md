# SS-Coh 

In State Space Coherence (SS-Coh) project, we provide mor robust algorithm for estimating Global Coherence (GCoh). 
To understand some aspects of SS-Coh modelling, you can read [EMBC-2019](EEG%20data%20from%20human%20patients%20under%20general%20anesthesi) and [bioRxiv-2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.199034v1.abstract). In the RO1 proposal, we provide more complete modelling of SS-Coh. 


## Data
To assess SS-Coh model, we use EEG data from human patients under general anesthesia. The data set was collected in Emery Brownâ€™s laboratory. 

The complete description of the experimental protocol can be found in [Purdon et al .](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1221180110) . Briefly, ten consenting human volunteers of ages 18-36 years were impaneled for the study approved by the MGH Human Research Committee. For each subject, the induction and emergence from propofol anesthesia were studied by administering a computer-controlled (StanPump) infusion of propofol using the target control protocol based on the Schnider pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model, while the subject executed a behavioral task to identify the points of loss and recovery of consciousness. Neural activity was recorded from 64 channels of EEG at a 250 Hz sampling rate.

Using this dataset, we will study the causal relationship between propofol blood concentration, level of consciousness, and spatio-temporal patterns of functional connectivity. Spectrograms, sliding window GCoh, and LDCM will be applied to identify network modes and their changes associated with loss of consciousness.

## Results

![ **Figure 1. SS-GCoh analysis in Alpha band for anesthesia EEG data and its correspondence with empirical results. A)** Inferred unconsciousness state estimation over 2 hours of anesthesia. The latent state represents the unconsciousness level; the state transition is modeled by a random-walk model. **B)** Scalp heat-map of the dominant eigenmodes for 3 different time points during the experiment. The result using SS-GCoh and empirical measures are similar to each other. **C)** Empirical GCoh and inferred GCoh using SS-GCoh. Not only the inferred coherence matches the empirical one; it attains it at a finer temporal resolution. With SS-GCoh, we also derive higher-order statistics of the coherence such as confidence interval.](imgs/fig1.jpg)
